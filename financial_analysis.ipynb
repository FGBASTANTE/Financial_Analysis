    "# Financial Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script is designed as a comprehensive tool for teaching fundamentals of investment analysis and decision-making. The script assumes all investments are discounted to year 0 (cash_flows[0]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Its functionalities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Financial metrics calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Measures the profitability of an investment, considering the time value of money.<br>\n",
    ">> **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Determines the discount rate at which the NPV of cash flows equals zero.<br>\n",
    ">> **Simple Payback Period (SPB)**: Calculates how long it takes to recover the initial investment without discounting future cash flows.<br>\n",
    ">> **Discounted Payback Period (DPP)**: Accounts for the time value of money while determining the payback period.<br>\n",
    ">> **Profitability Index (PI)**: Indicates the return per unit of investment.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Visualization of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Discounted Cash Flows**: A bar chart showing the present value of each cash flow.<br>\n",
    ">> **Cumulative Discounted Cash Flows**: A line chart highlighting the break-even point.<br>\n",
    ">> **NPV Sensitivity Analysis**: A line chart that demonstrates how NPV changes with varying discount rates, helping to assess the robustness of the investment under different scenarios.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Integrated Output:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Presents all calculated metrics in a clear, tabular format.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This script helps determine whether an investment is financially viable and provides tools to analyze its sensitivity to changes in discount rate assumptions.\n",
