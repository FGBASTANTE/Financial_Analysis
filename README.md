# Financial_Analysis

This Python script is designed as a comprehensive tool for teaching fundamentals of investment analysis and decision-making. The script assumes all investments are discounted to year 0 (cash_flows[0]).

Its functionalities include:

> ### Financial metrics calculation:

>> **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Measures the profitability of an investment, considering the time value of money.<br>
>> **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**: Determines the discount rate at which the NPV of cash flows equals zero.<br>
>> **Simple Payback Period (SPB)**: Calculates how long it takes to recover the initial investment without discounting future cash flows.<br>
>> **Discounted Payback Period (DPP)**: Accounts for the time value of money while determining the payback period.<br>
>> **Profitability Index (PI)**: Indicates the return per unit of investment.<br>

> ### Visualization of Results:

>> **Discounted Cash Flows**: A bar chart showing the present value of each cash flow.<br>
>> **Cumulative Discounted Cash Flows**: A line chart highlighting the break-even point.<br>
>> **NPV Sensitivity Analysis**: A line chart that demonstrates how NPV changes with varying discount rates, helping to assess the robustness of the investment under different scenarios.<br>

> ### Integrated Output:

>> Presents all calculated metrics in a clear, tabular format.<br>

This script helps determine whether an investment is financially viable and provides tools to analyze its sensitivity to changes in discount rate assumptions.
